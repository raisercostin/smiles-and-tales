Molly, the  pony,  
 And Ted, the big pig,  
 With the fancy wig  
 Went to the store, to buy a big bone

Charlie, their friend, was very upset.  
 Barking very loud and jumping around.  
 He was digging a hole, looking for a bone.  
 But he found instead a big chicken egg.  
 He said to himself: how lucky my friend!  
 Two chicks came outside, one yellow, one red,  
 And then the chicks,  got Charlie scared.

Molly the pony  
 And Ted, her big friend  
 Brought from the store instead of a bone,  
 A blue bouncy ball.  
 For Charlie to play, in the yard all day!
